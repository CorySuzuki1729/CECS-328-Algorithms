'''
Please use the code template below to complete your assignment.
Your code must be written in pa0 method. 
Do not change any other code. 
The evaluation code uses this templete to run your test cases.
Any changes other than pa0 method would cause the evaluation program
failure and you will not get credit for your submission.
